			<p style="text-align: left;">According to some ancient texts in the Temple on the island. The natives would worship their gods and the high god was named Lekann. Lekann ruled over
				the other gods and would appear to the natives as a child. He would bring gifts and laughter where ever he went. According to legened the island is
				extremly sacred. As it was the last resting place for the gods. The gods were at war with a great darkness and in the final days of the gods they
				had seeked shelter among the natives and had a temple build deep in the center of the island. However, the way to enter the temple was lost to time.
				Somewhere hidden on the island are sacred keys that each of the gods created to protet each of their magical artifacts that would give a native god like
				abilities. As of current the most known item is the Dagger of Toko.</p>
